# Text Encryptor - Oracle Next Education

## Project Description

This project is a text encryptor developed as part of the Oracle Next Education program challenge, group 7. The tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt text strings using a specific set of substitution rules. Its goal is to help protect simple messages using a basic encryption process.

## Project Status

Currently, the project is complete and in the maintenance phase. All main functionalities are operational and extensive testing has been carried out to ensure proper functioning.

## Demo of Functions and Applications

You can try the following features in our tool:

<ul>
  <li><stron>Encryption:</stron> Enter a message in the text field and click "Encrypt" to encrypt it.</li>
  <li><stron>Decryption:</stron> Encrypt a message and click "Decrypt" to revert it to its original form.</li>
  <li><stron>Copy:</stron> Use the "Copy" button to copy the encrypted message to the clipboard.</li>
  <li><stron>Reboot:</stron>Click "Reboot" to clear both text fields. </li>
</ul>

## Features

<ul>
  <li><strong>Text Encryption:</strong> Transforms any entered text string into an encrypted version following a predefined substitution pattern. Example: <code>"murcielago"</code> becomes <code>"mufatrcimesenterlaigober"</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Text Decryption:</strong> Reverses the encryption process, returning the original text from its encrypted form.</li>
  <li><strong>Input Compatibility:</strong> The encryptor only handles strings containing lowercase letters, ensuring consistent and predictable operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Web Interface:</strong> Users can interact with the tool through an intuitive web interface, suitable for any level of experience.</li>
</ul>
