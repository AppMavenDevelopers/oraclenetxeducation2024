# Text Encryptor - Oracle Next Education

## Project Description


This project is a text encryptor developed as part of the Oracle Next Education program challenge, group 7. The tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt text strings using a specific set of substitution rules. Its goal is to help protect simple messages using a basic encryption process.

## Features

<ul>
  <li><strong>Text Encryption:</strong> Transforms any entered text string into an encrypted version following a predefined substitution pattern. Example: <code>"murcielago"</code> becomes <code>"mufatrcimesenterlaigober"</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Text Decryption:</strong> Reverses the encryption process, returning the original text from its encrypted form.</li>
  <li><strong>Input Compatibility:</strong> The encryptor only handles strings containing lowercase letters, ensuring consistent and predictable operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Web Interface:</strong> Users can interact with the tool through an intuitive web interface, suitable for any level of experience.</li>
</ul>
